My name is Zhang Lei, living in Beijing China. A big city full of memories and mystery.

- Reading all kinds of books enjoy my life a lot
- Playing Basketball for a long time, back to high school. Still playing since this is so fun. Chicago Bulls back to 1990s is my favorite team at all time. MJ, Scottie, Rodman, yeah, real basketball.
- Foosball is another hobby of mine. 8 years till now, and I found so much fun in it. Leaning new skills, strategy, applying it during match. Making new friends all over the world.
